# my_code
In my Bachelor thesis I show the efficiency and multiplicity of Migromegas detectors of New Small Wheel of ATLAS detector.Here i have upload the codes which I create.Until now,I have done the calculations based on ATLAS Monte Carlo data.You can find this in this folder.
I use C/C++ and run my codes via ROOT CERN prompt.
